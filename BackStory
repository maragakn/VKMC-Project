Dear Joe,

Thanks for meeting us last week. We’re really looking forward to working with you and your colleagues at the the City of New York Government.
With access to the turnstile metro data, we hope to help you plan allocation of the City’s resources by looking at how footfall has changed over time in particular neighborhoods to give you an idea of up-and-coming neighborhoods.  This would allow you to assess whether to increase resources or change planning of zoning, for example.

Many thanks,
Project VK MC
